# Home Library Catalog

Home Library Catalog is a simple application to quicky input books from your personal library and store them into a .txt file on your system. This .txt file can be edited if need be. 

# How to Use

HLC is pretty simple. From the main menu, simply click on the Input Book Information button to input book data. After you have filled in the data, click the save button. 

Click the clear button to clear the fields and enter in another book. Do this until your fingers bleed. 

After you have input your books, click "File" and then "Save to Library." This will save your recently input data into the .txt file. 

You can view your recently inputted books by hitting the Exit button, then click on the View Catalog button.

# Importing saved data

To view your books saved from earlier sessions, from the main menu, click on Books, then click on Import Catalog. This will now show yoou all of your books. 

# IMPORTANT 

As of now, if you were to save to library after importing your catalog, you will essentially duplicate all the previous entered data. I will be working on a fix to this soon.
